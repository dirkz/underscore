This is a patched Underscore.js for use in QML. In this example, I use it in a JavaScript
file:

```
.pragma library
.import "underscore/underscore.js" as U

var _ = U.init();

function doNothing(json) {
    return _.map(json, _.identity );
}
```

For use directly in QML, the following *might* work (not tested):

```
import "underscore.js" as U
property var _: U.init();
```

Underscore.js is a utility-belt library for JavaScript that provides
support for the usual functional suspects (each, map, reduce, filter...)
without extending any core JavaScript objects.
